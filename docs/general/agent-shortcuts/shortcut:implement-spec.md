Shortcut: Implement Spec

Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Review the spec (if spec is unclear ask for clarification on which spec to use).

2. Review @docs/general/agent-rules/ for relevant rules relevant to implementing this
   spec and @docs/general/agent-guidelines/general-tdd-guidelines.md to understand all
   project and testing rules.

3. Begin implementing the spec.
   IMPORTANT: *Track all work with beads.* Make as much progress as possible, following
   all rules and workflows, and following @shortcut:precommit-process.md at each phase.

4. At the end of each phase confirm with the user before proceeding to the next phase.
